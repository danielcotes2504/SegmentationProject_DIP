# Segmentation Project using Digital Image Processing (Python 3.7)

This project was developed as a practice related to the segmentation based on Digital Image Processing, where you can control the image brightness or opacity with a circle-detection system. You can use it for your projects!

After you have downloaded the project and opened it, it's necessary to have Python 3 already installed on your computer, in this case I have used the version 3.7.
Then you need to import the modules numpy and opencv to run the project. For this purpose you need to run on command prompt the following commands:

``` pip install numpy ```
``` pip install opencv-python ```

Here it's attached a video that shows how it works:
